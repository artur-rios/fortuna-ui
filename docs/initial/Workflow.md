# Workflow — Fortuna UI

How a single use case is delivered, from picking it up to closing it out. The formal, normative
version of this process lives in the
[Development Workflow Document](../requirements/Development%20Workflow%20Document.md); this document
is the operational form an implementer follows step by step.

It is the same workflow the [Fortuna API](https://github.com/artur-rios/fortuna-api) and the
[Heimdall API](https://github.com/artur-rios/heimdall-api) use, deliberately — one process across
every repository.

> **One use case = one branch = one issue = one pull request.**

## Invocation

Work starts when a use case is named by its identifier, e.g. `UC-03`. If the identifier is missing
or ambiguous, ask which one before doing anything else. One pass handles exactly **one** use case —
unless a batch run has been authorized up front, in which case see
[Step 7.1](#step-71--authorized-batch-runs).

## The golden rule: pause at every stage boundary

The work is reviewed before it advances. Therefore:

- **The only status change made unattended is `Todo → In Progress`**, right after the branch is
  created. It signals that work has begun.
- **Every other stage transition requires explicit approval first.** Before moving to **Testing**,
  before opening a **pull request**, and before moving to **Done**, stop, show what was done, and
  ask. Do not batch these.
- **Never merge the pull request, never self-approve, never delete the branch.** Review, merge and
  branch deletion are human actions. An agent may *prepare and push* the pull request.

When pausing, summarize what the stage completed, state what comes next, and wait for a clear
go-ahead.

## Workflow overview

```
Load specs → Refine (design → plan) → [approval] → Branch + issue→In Progress
  → Implement → [approval] → issue→Testing → Test until green → [approval]
  → Open PR → [human review + merge + delete branch] → [approval] → issue→Done
```

Steps 1–2 and every `[approval]` gate are where the implementer stops.

---

## Step 1 — Load the specifications

Read the relevant requirements documents before designing anything. Pull the specifics for this use
case; do not work from memory:

- [Use Case Specification Document](../requirements/Use%20Case%20Specification%20Document.md)
  — the target use case: actors, pre/postconditions, main flow, and every `AF-xx` alternative flow.
- [System Requirements Document](../requirements/System%20Requirements%20Document.md)
  — the `FR-xx` requirements traced to it, plus the screen surface, the state model, and the
  authorization matrix.
- [Development Workflow Document](../requirements/Development%20Workflow%20Document.md)
  — the normative delivery process.
- [Testing Specification Document](../requirements/Testing%20Specification%20Document.md)
  — how the tests will be written.
- [Technology Stack Document](../requirements/Technology%20Stack%20Document.md)
  — the libraries, versions, and patterns to build with.

Because this application is a client, one more source is often needed: the **endpoints this use
case calls**, in the [Fortuna API](https://github.com/artur-rios/fortuna-api)'s own System
Requirements and Use Case Specification documents. Read the API's contract rather than guessing at
it, and never assume a field the generated client does not carry.

Then locate the tracking issue for this use case.

## Step 2 — Refine the design and plan

The specification is the *what*; a repository-specific *how* is still needed before coding.

1. **Design** — turn the specification and its traced requirements into a concrete design for this
   codebase: which screens, routes, providers, repositories, form validators and widgets are
   needed; which generated client calls each flow makes; and how every alternative flow maps to
   what the user actually sees — an inline field error, an empty state, a retry, a sign-in prompt.
   Ground it in the patterns already present in the repository — and, where this repository has not
   grown one yet, in the equivalent pattern in the Heimdall UI.
2. **Plan** — capture the result as a written, step-by-step implementation plan, sequenced
   test-first per the Testing Specification.

**Present the refined design and plan, and wait for approval before writing any code.** This is the
first review gate.

## Step 3 — Branch and move the issue to In Progress

Once the plan is approved, create the branch from an up-to-date `main` using the naming pattern
`feature/uc-##-use-case-name`:

```bash
git switch main && git pull
git switch -c feature/uc-01-sign-in-with-credentials
```

- `##` — the zero-padded use case number.
- `use-case-name` — the use case name in lower-case kebab-case.

Then — the **one** status change made without asking — move the issue to **In Progress**.

## Step 4 — Implement

Execute the approved plan, following the repository's established patterns. Implement the main flow
**and every alternative flow** from the specification. Grow the implementation and its tests
together. Commit on the branch as you go.

Two rules bind every change in this repository specifically:

- **No monetary value ever becomes a `double`.** Not in a model, not in a widget, not in an
  intermediate expression, not in a test fixture.
- **Never hand-edit the generated API client.** If the client is wrong, the API's OpenAPI document
  is wrong; fix it there and regenerate.

## Step 5 — Pause for review before Testing

When the implementation is code-complete, **stop and ask** before advancing. Summarize what was
built. Only after approval, move the issue to **Testing**.

## Step 6 — Test until green

Following the [Testing Specification Document](../requirements/Testing%20Specification%20Document.md),
write the tests for this use case (main flow + each applicable `AF-xx`), run the suite, fix
failures, and **re-run until everything passes**:

```bash
flutter test
```

Run the analyzer as well — an analysis failure is a failure:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

Integration tests are run separately, per the Testing Specification. A use case does not leave the
Testing stage until the full suite is green.

Report the passing results. **Do not open a pull request yet — stop and ask.**

## Step 7 — Open the pull request (after approval)

Once approved, push the branch and open a pull request from `feature/uc-##-…` into `main`,
referencing the issue so the merge closes it. Then **hand off to a human** for review and merge.
Do **not** merge or delete the branch.

### Step 7.1 — Authorized batch runs

When several use cases are delivered in one unattended run, the approval gates would stop the run at
every use case, which defeats the point of batching them. For a **batch run only**, an agent may
merge its own pull requests, subject to all of the following:

- **The batch was authorized up front.** A human agreed to the specific use cases, in order, and was
  told explicitly that the agent would merge, close the issues and delete the branches. A general
  instruction to work autonomously is not this authorization.
- **The invariant still holds.** One use case = one branch = one issue = one pull request. Use cases
  are never batched into a shared branch or a shared pull request, so the run stays reviewable
  after the fact.
- **The testing gate is unchanged.** The full suite is run and read for every use case, per Step 6.
  A merge on an unread or failing suite is never permitted.
- **No protection is bypassed.** No administrative override merge, no self-approval to satisfy a
  required review, no force-push, and no disabling or filtering of a test to make the suite green.
- **A failure stops the whole run.** A red suite, a merge conflict, an ambiguous specification, or a
  requirement that does not exist ends the batch. Already-merged use cases stay merged; the failing
  branch and its pull request are left in place as evidence.

Outside an authorized batch run, Step 7 applies as written: a human reviews and a human merges.

## Step 8 — Close out (after the merge)

After the pull request is merged and the branch deleted, **ask** before finishing, then move the
issue to **Done** and confirm it is closed.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Implemented on a `feature/uc-##-use-case-name` branch created from `main`.
- [ ] Main flow and every alternative flow implemented, each with the interface behavior the
      specification defines for it.
- [ ] Unit tests cover each provider, repository, validator and formatter (main + applicable
      `AF-xx`).
- [ ] Widget tests cover each screen the use case adds or changes, including its error, empty and
      loading states.
- [ ] Integration tests cover the end-to-end flow where the Testing Specification calls for one.
- [ ] `flutter analyze` is clean and `flutter test` is green, and line coverage holds at or above
      the floor.
- [ ] No monetary value is represented as a `double` anywhere in the change.
- [ ] The generated API client was not hand-edited.
- [ ] The pull request was merged to `main` — reviewed by a human, or merged by an agent under an
      authorized batch run (Step 7.1).
- [ ] The branch was deleted.
- [ ] The issue is in **Done** and closed.
